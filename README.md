# learning haskell

This is just a personal scratchpad with some Haskell code from various sources
as I go through the process of learning some Haskell for the 1000th time (at
least ðŸ¤·)... and maybe some notes.

I have tried to learn Haskell multiple times in the past, but for some reason or

resources since I last tried, figured I'd give it another go and try to stick
with it.

Let's see how that goes...
